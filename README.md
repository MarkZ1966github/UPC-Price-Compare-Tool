# UPC-Price-Compare-Tool
This compares prices between Amazon, Walmart, and eBay 

It's basically a web scraper that does a lot of cool things as it's easily expandable for other sites like Target, Sears, Kohls, etc.. etc... 

This does work, or semi-works. Needs some love (tweaking) as with any web scraper tool, sites change and adjustments need to be made on the fly to make it 100% working. 

Enjoy and hopefully someone has fun making this bette (dynamic in some way)  or including a bunch more sites.
